# TUIJam
A fancy TUI client for Google Play Music.

TUIJam seeks to make a simple, attractive, terminal-based interface to
listening to music for Google Play Music All-Access subscribers.

# Dependencies
* [Python >= 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads)
* [mpv](https://mpv.io)
* [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)

# Installation
To install from source
```bash
git clone git@github.com:cfangmeier/tuijam.git
cd tuijam
python setup.py install --user
```

or from pypi
```bash
pip install --user tuijam
```

or from the AUR
```bash
yay -S tuijam  # mainline
yay -S tuijam-git # dev build
```

# Configuration
When you first launch TUIJam, it checks for a config file in `$HOME/.config/tuijam/config.yaml` with the following content:
```yaml
email: you@your-email.com
password: your-password
device_id: yourdeviceid
```
If this file doesn't exist, TUIJam will guide you through a first-time setup where you will need to supply your google music email, password, and (optionally) a separate password to encrypt your google credentials locally.

Note that if you have 2-factor setup on your Google account, you need to make
an app-password for TUIJam.

## Additional Configuration

  - `persist_queue`: (Default: `True`) Saves the current queue and reloads it when the app resumes
  - `reverse_scrolling`: (Default: `False`) Switches the direction of mouse scrolling

# MPRIS Support
TUIJam supports a subset of the [MPRIS](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/) spec to allow for external control via clients such as [playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl). Currently, the following behavior is supported:

  - Get current song metadata (Title/Album/Artist)
  - Get player status (Playing/Paused/Stopped)
  - Play/Pause current song
  - Next Song
  - Stop

If this causes problems for you, please feel free to create an issue, but this feature can also be disabled by placing the following line in your config file:

```yaml
mpris_enabled: false
```
# Youtube
From version 0.3.0, Youtube videos are included in search results. By default, no video is shown during playback, but this can be changed by adding the following line to the config file:

```yaml
video: true
```
